# PriceUpgradeScalingMod (Zmazor Mod)

> 🎮 A BepInEx mod for Unity-based multiplayer games that synchronizes upgrade prices and balances progression for all players.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Upgrade prices scale based on the number of players.
- ✅ Upgrades are shared between all players (everyone has the best upgrades from the team).
- ✅ Simple configuration via `BepInEx/config/PriceUpgradeScaling.cfg`.

## ⚙️ Formula

Upgrade cost is calculated as:

```
price = base + (players - 1) * scale
```

Example: With `scale = 0.8` and 3 players:
```
price = base * (1 + (3 - 1) * 0.8) = base * 2.6
```
